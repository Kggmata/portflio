            <h4>Brief</h4>
            <p>
                The fundamental foundation is that Australia is home to a vast range of unusual plants and animals.
                Then,
                both plants and animals face extinction issues. The main aim of the topic is to increase public
                understanding of the value of conserving biodiversity.

                        This dataset is about the distribution of flora in Queensland. The dataset protects a
                        comprehensive
                        range of
                        animal species. Include all kingdoms, classes, families, and species. It also contains
                        individual
                        information about the animal. Some of the animals have animal sighting information, location
                        information,
                        text descriptions and pictures.

            <h2 id="A2SummaryAndReflection">Summary and reflection</h2>
            <h3 id="A2SummaryAndReflectionWhatLearned">What learned?</h3>
            <p>
                I have learned a efficient process of create and structure an idea.
                Basically choosing a basic direction and then seeking inspiration. For example, the direction can be
                flora and fauna. And the inspiration can be a random idea generator or similar website in the topic.
            </p>
            <p>Next, determine the details of the idea step by step. The first is the target audience, followed by the
                problem description and the goal of the site. Then, explore the problem space based on the
                aforementioned target audience. In the context of the problem, and in conjunction with the API,
                determine the functionality and interaction of the site. Think about how your target audience will use
                these interactions and features, and then.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, can use tools to create virtualizing components like a poster.
            </p>
            <h3 id="A2SummaryAndReflectionChallenges">Challenges and future improvements</h3>
            <p>
                The main difficulty is that the initial stage is very confusing, each of the 6 directions contains many
                possibilities, and the idea from the random idea generator is very random. So it's hard to come up with
                a specific idea.
                If I do this again, I will figure out more details in terms of design. For example, the target
                audience can be further refined. A more specific target audience will help clarify the site's design
                concept.
                Then as for the interaction, which can also be further refined and add more functionalities. After that,
                the design
                style of the website can also be refined according to the target user, such as the target user is an
                outdoor lover, then the style of the website can be natural and tough, the main color is adjusted to
                green, brown and
                so on.
            </p>
            <p>
                In terms of technology, since I am familiar with the use and content of apis, I can look for more
                available
                apis to help implement website functions. For example, I can use map API and animal sightings in QLD
                wildlife API to display surrounding animals.

                Concept generation
            </h2>
            <p>
                The first to identify is the topic, the topic of our team was decided to be FloraAndFauna after
                discussion. This topic was chosen for several
                reasons.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    First and first, the majority of the team members are interested in
                    plants and animals. According to our team information website, the topic of Flora and Fauna receives
                    the
                    highest score and may most effectively convey the common thoughts of the team.
                </li>
                <li>Two of our members also selected the topics of flora and fauna for their posters, indicating that
                    some searches have been conducted on the relevant datasets in this topic.
                </li>
                <li>The development of the flora and wildlife, on the other hand, has a lot of potential and room to do.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Then we looked at the posters displayed on the Miro and had a discussion about the various posters
                that each member found intriguing. There are eight posters in the "Flora and Fauna" category.(Studio One
                Design Inspirations, n.d.)
                We immediately noticed the topic called Garden Watch. However, we discussed and considered various
                implementation potential options. The topic requires a GPS implementation and a map connection to track
                the current
                location of the garden monitor. The design require a 3D representation of the garden. After
                careful
                consideration, we decided to give it up because it would cause a lot of unnecessary complexity.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also found the topic Queensland's rare flora map, flora and fauna conservation and Fauna peripherals
                were
                very
                similar. They both use maps to show the distribution of species, with the goal of helping people realize
                that species are in danger. These three sites are similar to information display sites, the main
                interaction
                is through the map for query and viewing.
            </p>
            <p>
                At this point, we were almost certain that the project concept is a map of endangered species. Then, one
                of
                the team members came up with a more interesting concept: a game in which players are given game body
                parts
                and asked to identify what they are.
            </p>
            <p>
                The advantages of this idea are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>It used games instead of maps to narrow the target audience to children, which helped define the
                    overall
                    style of the site.
                </li>
                <li>In addition, there are more specific aspects of games that can help narrow down the topic. We can
                    focus
                    on figuring out how to do this basic feature before moving on to other features.
                </li>
                <li>The game is more engaging than the map and can attract more users</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                After discussion, the initial structure of our project was to create a game for children that connects
                images of
                animals
                with facts or knowledge about animals. Children, especially those in primary school or kindergarten, are
                the
                target audience for this website.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also created a mind map of the concepts, which greatly helped us to identify the main concepts
                and
                ideas. The main feature of our site is games. Essentially, the game is
                about showing the player (a child) images of various animal body parts and asking them to guess the
                image by
                text typing, selecting, dragging, or clicking.

            <p>After rapid design sprint, the main idea of our team project was to create a website of which the main
                functionality is a game for children that connects images of
                animals
                with facts or knowledge about animals. Children, especially those in primary school or kindergarten, are
                the
                target audience for this idea.

                What learned?
            </h3>
            <p>
                The purpose of the rapid design Sprint is to obtain the team project concept from each person's own
                posters
                from design inspiration and through brainstorm.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through this practice, I learned how to efficiently determine and plan the design ideas of a project in
                a
                team.
            </p>
            <p>First of all, we got inspirations. Then, we brainstorm a unified idea framework by watching similar
                website and others ideas.
            </p>
            <p> We started with the target audience and identify problem statement. Next, according to the main
                API,
                determine the functions and interaction of the site.
                Through features and interaction, then find the corresponding auxiliary API.

            <p>
                This time a lot of time was spent figuring out the process. If we do it again, we will pay more
                attention to
                the perfection of concept details. For example, in terms of APIs, we can find more auxiliary APIs and
                think of more interesting functionalities. For example, we can add more types of game.
            </p>
            <p>
                Meanwhile, I will focus on the target audience aspect and narrow down the target audience, and think
                about
                their application scenario.

                After generating the final concept of team project, we decide to construct the digital prototype first
                to better virtualize the idea and we can do quick modifications on it.

            <p>
                I did researches on the datasets and problem areas and created a poster to outline my thoughts. I then
                participated in discussions in the studio, contributing ideas and helping to shape our team's final
                design concept.
            </p>
            <p>
                In summary, there have been two stages leading up to this point for the early proof of concept designs.
                First, during studio time, we discuss the potential topics, select the idea, and structure the idea.
            </p>
            <p>
                After studio, we then made the decision to begin constructing a low-fidelity prototype each member to
                visualize the
                concept after the studio and the prototype can also be used for user testing and quick modifications. I
                used Figma to make my side of prototype.

            <p>. Then we discussed
                each one’s idea in the team meeting on Monday, August 22.
                The interpretation and design I came up with are described here, some of which have been altered after
                team discussions.

                I was the initial review's presenter. I learned a great deal in the process. The first is that the
                speech should not be comprehensive and exhaustive. Instead, concentrate on a few key concepts and cover
                as many angles as feasible. Likewise, there is no need for technical details from the standpoint of the
                audience; to engage the audience, it is most vital to ensure that they comprehend. Moreover, speakers
                should slow down. To avoid being nervous, I envision myself conversing with pals during the actual
                presentation.
            </p>
            <p>
                After presenting the Design Proposal Milestone, we received some insightful comments. There are two
                crucial aspects of content-based feedback:
            <ul>
                <li>Children cannot access certain computer websites</li>
                <li>Children require simple and engaging activities</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                For target audience, we include the parents and teachers of the youngsters. In this instance, adults can
                assist children in accessing and operating websites
                via computers; adults can serve as guides, and after teaching children how to operate, they can provide
                supplementary knowledge explanations. Children should be able to obtain prizes for winning the game.
                Based on the content of this input, every member of our team has engaged in further reflection.
            </p>
            <p>
                The
                initial concern relates to the barriers between youngsters and websites/computers. It is prudent to
                include the child's parents or teachers in the target audience. However, the debate arises as to whether
                the look and substance of the website should be tailored to adults. Our response is no.
            </p>
            <p>
                Children should continue to be the major audience for websites, and websites should be designed for
                them. The roles of parents and teachers are merely that of guides and assistants, not actual users,
                despite the fact that parents are in fact users of the website. Therefore, when we design, we still
                begin with children's cognition and psychology as our starting point. The website can be used as a
                parent-led game and a teacher's educational tool to assist children learn about and comprehend animals.
                Also, youngsters between the ages of 6 and 12 who are interested in animals will be a more ideal
                audience because they have sufficient computer/website access and operation skills. This also simplifies
                user testing, as kindergarteners are already able to convey their emotions precisely and responsibly,
                and we do not have to worry about how to test with them. Therefore, the target audience will consist of
                animal-loving children aged 6 to 12 and their parents and instructors. In addition, we will develop a
                website with animal-themed guessing games with animal knowledge as the material.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second relates to how youngsters interact with the website. The interaction should be easy. Due to
                their psychological and cognitive immaturity, youngsters like simple, direct, and intuitive things. We
                will avoid complex page layouts, function buttons, and textual statements in the design of our website.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead, we will utilize a single page, as few and straightforward buttons as possible, and icons. There
                are a few merits.
            <ul>
                <li>The game's functions are contained on a single page</li>
                <li>Continuous operations should be simplified through the use of automatic pop-up messages, such as
                    message boxes with buttons.
                </li>
                <li>Instead of discussing the process in words, the prompt for the operation might visually remind the
                    user of the next operation by flashing and resizing the button.
                </li>
                <li>Various portions of the website should also be represented with visual representations, such as a
                    desktop or a book for the game area.
                    Avoid utilizing text input in lieu of button selection. Interactions must be ongoing. Continuous
                    interaction contributes to user stickiness, making it appealing for young users to return to the
                    site to
                    play again. Here are some points.
                </li>
                <li>Display the user's winnings (gold coins, medals, trophies, etc.) and accomplishments when he or she
                    has won the game, as well as provide a list of cool names from which to choose.
                </li>
                <li>Record the number of times the user has won the game and the associated awards, and automatically
                    display this information to the user, in order to develop a dependency by satisfying the achievement
                    feeling.
                </li>
                <li>Prompt and encourage the user to play the following round in order to create a continuous
                    interaction.
                </li>
                <li>Allows youngsters to play and converse anthropomorphically with a cartoon character, making them
                    feel
                    less like they are operating a cold machine. It all comes down to the enjoyment of the game.
                    Regarding
                    this, we also hold the following beliefs:
                </li>
                <li>Variable and random game components. The game's content should be varied and optional, and children
                    should be able to select different animal images at any moment by clicking on different buttons.
                    Various
                    background modifications are supplied to correspond with the animal being guessed. And for added
                    fun,
                    the implementation method underlying these modifications can be made to be random.
                </li>
                <li>Diverse game rewards Likewise, game incentives should be varied. After winning a game or achieving a
                    particular number of victories, the website will deliver feedback in the form of gold coins,
                    trophies,
                    medals, and titles.
                </li>
                <li>Unique video game characters User roles might be exclusive. By selecting to play the game as a
                    variety
                    of characters, it is possible to acquire rewards pertaining to those characters. The aforementioned
                    three factors correspond to the beginning of website design, the specific general design, and the
                    functional design. This is our team's reaction to your feedback; we appreciate your input. We hope
                    to
                    improve our designs even further.
                    For future enhancements, we may conduct further user tests to get input from our target consumers.

                In week nine, our group did a work-in-progress presentation and received feedback from our tutor and
                peers. This time, we received favorable feedback as opposed to negative feedback in the last design
                report.
                We have effectively addressed some of the flaws that existed in the past and advanced the entire
                project. This time around, the game's fundamental features were rather well-developed, and we
                constructed a minimal viable product (MVP) according to plan. Feedback is more concerned with usefulness
                and engagement than aesthetics, thus we will concentrate on providing transparent and instructional
                feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
                The critique centered on two negative issues: the first concerned the game's intended demographic and
                primary functioning, and the second concerned the site game's feature design.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our target audience for our website is changed to children aged 6-12 according to the feedback from the
                last critique. They are in a period of curiosity and imagination. So they are willing to learn and
                interact with websites about animal games.
            </p>
            <p>
                Queensland is a wildlife-rich region that is home to a variety of fascinating and intriguing species.
                Children from Queensland are interested in learning more about the animals; children from other regions
                will be interested in seeing animals that are different from their own. Games are a terrific method to
                engage users with your site's content. Longer game interactions strengthen the relationship between the
                user and the website, allowing more information to be given to the user.
            </p>
            <p>
                The game takes the form of solving puzzles. Because the jigsaw puzzle is a classic and simple game, the
                simple function and appropriate difficulty make players need to spend a certain amount of time to
                complete it, but will not consume too much energy and lose the fun.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are multiple modes of puzzle setting complexity. Different game difficulties will accommodate
                different pupils and provide a step-by-step mastery progression. In conjunction with the success
                tracking system, the improvement in children's play level shown by this procedure will offer children a
                sense of accomplishment and strengthen their sense of participation. We chose to implement three
                distinct levels of difficulty — easy, medium, and challenging — and varied game elements and prizes to
                enrich the gameplay.
            </p>
            <p> Create the game's backstory and provide the player characters. By establishing a
                distinct tale setting, connect all game elements — animal information, graphics, game features, and
                player characters — together.
                This will aid us in designing the aesthetics and functionality of the game and website, since developing
                clear game aspects will assist us in identifying the precise tasks that must be completed. This will
                also assist users build a stronger connection with the site, giving their use of the site greater
                significance, and improve the possibility that they will utilize the site. We chose to emphasize animals
                and adventure, and the user's character would be a wilderness adventurer. Provide options for game
                aspects. The options below include animal categories, game interface backgrounds, user characters, and
                game rewards.
            </p>
            <p>These aspects of the game should be compatible with one another. For instance, the
                interface background matches the present surroundings of the animals; the game's awards reflect the
                level of protection and status of the animal. By selecting various components of the game, the player
                constructs a mental reference object that correlates to those elements. Various game Settings, for
                instance, instill in the player's head distinct ideas of animal habitats.

            <p>
                I have learned a lot through the process.
                First of all, I learned a complete product design process. The first is to identify the topic to get
                inspiration, by looking at other similar sites, browsing APIs, etc.
                Then from inspiration to idea to concept. First determine the target user, then determine the problem
                statement, then determine the purpose, then determine the main functional interaction of the website,
                then determine the style and other details. By poster, MindMap, storyboard and other means.
                Then, through concept to digital prototype by inVision, Figma or other tools. Paper prototype can be
                used for user testing, as it can iterate
                quickly to feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for coding, websites mainly use HTML, CSS, JS for front-end implementation and PHP for the back end
                implementation, including HTML dynamic generation and data collection and storage. Back-end often
                implemented as linux servers like UQ Team Zone and can connect to the server via SSH
                using shell. For example, popular shell terminal software include MobaXterm, PuTTY, FileZilla,
                FinalShell etc. To access to the server, input the server IP address, username and password.
                Then I can use the terminal to connect to the server.
            </p>
            <p>
                Interaction with numerous APIs is a crucial component of a website's implementation. Watch the API
                documentation in order to know the API's rules and how to access it. To utilize these APIs, I am
                typically needed to create an account and acquire an API key. The API can then be accessed using the API
                key. I can generate simple API calls to test connectivity initially. It is possible to submit HTTP
                requests via the browser, with tools such as Postman, ApiFox, or with JS or PHP, among other techniques.
                After receiving the response, I am certain that the API is available and can construct complex requests
                as required. AJAX in JS or file get contents in PHP can be used to construct an API call. And the
                response data is frequently a JSON string. I can use json decode to convert a string back to JSON, and
                then retrieve the necessary data using a key:value pair.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cache is an important part of website implementation that can be used to drastically improve loading
                time or remember user information such as login status, previous operations, etc. localStorage is used
                to implement local caching in JS. In PHP, can use file_put_contents. To recognize that cache is
                frequently in string format, it is necessary to convert to JSON format or other format before using and
                to string format
                before saving. Also, the cache expiration time can be specified to prevent cache overflow.
            </p>
            <p>
                After getting the data, then I can do some modifications to the data and then display it on the website.
                For example, filter the data. It often used in search function or data preprocessing. There are many
                ways to filter data. One important way to filter string is regular expression.
            </p>
            <p>
                I can also save data in the backend database in order to reduce the number of API requests and loading
                time. This is possible with PHP PDO (PHP data object). To save data to the database, I can first log
                in with the username and password. Create the database and tables using SQL DDL. Then, using SQL
                DML, insert the data into the table. SQL DQL is used to obtain data from the database. For instance, our
                website uses inner join to filter animals that does not contain photos.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have also learned about valuable APIs, including the QLD wildlife API, Flickr API, Wikipedia API,
                Google font API, Google map API, and Leaflet map API.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have also learned how to use various of libraries and frameworks such jQuery, Chocolate JS etc.
                These libraries contain numerous helpful functions that can be used to efficiently implement certain
                functions.
            </p>
            <p>
                I learned a great deal about presenting as well. Instead of technical complexities, the presentation
                should focus on the presentation's primary ideas and consider the audience's perspective more. The
                objective is for the listener to comprehend the speech's topic. A typical presentation should include an
                introduction, the main body, and a conclusion.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for design perspective, I learnt how to use color, layout, etc. to produce a positive user experience
                from a design
                standpoint. I've learned how to design an effective interaction response by animation of hover, click,
                and sound
                effects.
            </p>
            <p>In addition, I've learnt what a comprehensive website should include. Each page contains a title,
                navigation bar, and footer. A website should have a homepage, functionality pages with the website's
                primary functionalities, a about page for introduction and references, a contact page for user feedback,
                and a user page with login, signup, and user information.

            <ul>
                <li>The QLD Wild Life API now used as the primary dataset. The data is reasonably complete, and it is
                    simple to
                    utilize. The issue is that some of the data is incomplete, outdated, or inaccurate. For instance,
                    there
                    are a large portion of missing animal photos. Data on animal sightings are back ten years out of
                    date.
                    Many species lack of text descriptions and information about their endangered status. There are
                    various
                    aspects where the animal data might be enhanced.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Can collect animal data by ourselves and create our own animal dataset. That can improve the
                        accuracy
                        and completion of animal data.
                    </li>
                    <li>Use a filtering algorithm or technique to better filter out the inaccurate animal data. or
                        instance,
                        we may employ specialists to enhance and filter the animal data. To help increase the accuracy
                        and
                        timeliness of data, we could also add user feedback or bury points with big data technique in
                        web
                        pages.
                    </li>
                    <li>Bring in more data sources. Currently, QLD wild life API serves as our primary data source.
                        Using
                        wiki
                        text and images from Flickr, display animal detail information. We can include additional data
                        resources. For instance, right now. There are some statistics on the status of animal
                        conservation,
                        but
                        none on the reasons why the animals are in danger. We may therefore include additional
                        information
                        source for this aspect.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Front-end implementation: The current front-end buttons and feedback are relatively simple, most of
                    them are shake effects, and the sound effect is relatively monotonous. There are several aspects
                    that
                    can be improved.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The first is a comprehensive beginner's guide, which provides guidance to help users understand
                        the
                        detailed use of the site.
                    </li>
                    <li>Enhance the dynamic effect of the website, including the hover effect of the button, click
                        effect,
                        sliding animation, loading animation and so on.
                    </li>
                    <li>To produce unique graphics and other UI designs, we can either hire an artist or try to bring in
                        the
                        latest AI drawing technology.
                    </li>
                    <li>Enrich the sound effects, especially the pertinence of the sound effects, such as monkey
                        pictures
                        can
                        produce the sound of monkeys, the sound can also be changed at different time, so that make the
                        website
                        more alive.
                    </li>
                    <li>Responsive design can also prompt. At present, the web page is only displayed normally on the PC
                        side,
                        but the display is incorrect for the mobile phone screen and other special-shaped screens. We
                        can
                        add
                        support for more screens of different proportions, and for different devices.

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>In terms of back-end implementation, the current website is based on team zone's MySQL database.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>For now, the back-end depends on the team zone. In the future, we can consider finding another
                        back-end service provider or deploying our own back-end server.
                    </li>
                    <li>Functionally, there is no user login system and no user database in the back end. At the same
                        time,
                        the web page has no local caching capability.
                    </li>
                    <li>Can add user database to store user name, password, and including game records, login records
                        and
                        other statistical information. In front-end, construct the corresponding login page and user
                        setting
                        interface. Local caching of user login data cookies, as well as some other information, helps
                        speed
                        up
                        the loading of web pages.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add a user leader board functionality to rank users based on the number of points they earned by
                        playing the game.
                    </li>
                    <li>More game types can be added to target children and site-themed animals. For example, Monopoly
                        games,
                        given pictures to guess animals and so on.
                    </li>

                Portfolio is a demonstration that includes much of what I have learned this semester. Also, this is an
                excellent opportunity to evaluate the entire journey and summarize what was learnt. There are other
                improvements that may be made to the portfolio, including the addition of sound effects, PHP back-end
                implementation,
                caching login
                information in the back end database, etc.

            <p>This course covers the whole process from design to code implementation, and I learned a lot from it. In
                general, the course includes the design phase, the code implementation phase. In the design stage, I
                learned how to acquire idea and how to develop an effective idea into a complete concept.

            <p>
                At the same time, I also gained experience in presentation, including how to make ppt and speech skills.
                I got the most out of the code. I am more proficient in HTML, CSS and JS I have learned before.
            </p>
            <p>
                Meanwhile, I have gained new knowledge of PHP back-end, database and API. Now I can independently design
                and code a website and deploy it to a back-end server.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the same time, I also learned how to work in a team. On the one hand, members should communicate
                effectively with each other to know each other's strengths and weaknesses. On the other hand, maintain
                constant communication. The division of labor is also very important. Generally, there is a team leader,
                and then some members are more involved in design, and some members are mainly responsible for code
                implementation.
            </p>
            <h2 id="reflectionOfCourseFuture">Future</h2>
            <p>
                In the future I can get greater depth of knowledge, such as how PHP engine and JS work,
                etc. These are quite useful for debugging.However, I would like to broaden the scope to include major
                front-end frameworks such as Bootstrap, React, etc. These frameworks include prebuilt libraries for
                speedier development and a better user experience.On the back-end, I will continue to learn Linux, Nginx
                in-depth, and more databases, such as Redis, PostGreSQL, Oracle, and Clickhouse.
            </p>
            <p>
                Concurrently, I will also read certain books regarding the code itself, on the one hand to make the
                project structure more regular, optimize the code structure, and optimize the readability. Learn data
                structures and algorithms to reduce code's temporal complexity and make it run quicker, use less space,
                and enhance code efficiency.
